| r              | Red       | `ff3305` |

**Note:** Please don't use red adjacent to pink, it looks like trash. Thanks!

### Alternate colours (use to diversify from the main palette)
| Filename code* | Name      | Hex code |
|----------------|-----------|----------|
| y              | Yellow    | `ffb829` |
| g              | Green     | `0ac800` |

\* The filename code is the letter used in the filenames for the assets to represent the colour. If two colours are used in an asset, the background colour will come first, followed by the foreground colour.
